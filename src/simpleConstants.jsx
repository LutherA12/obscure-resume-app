      I've been programming in React for about 1 and a half years consistantly
      and can build webpage applications. I also have experience in using hooks
      and Firebase, as well as some experience with Python, however, I got some
      really good advice from another developer who has been at it for about 5
      years. He told me{" "}
      <span className="accents">
        "focus on one thing, you can learn the rest over time"
      </span>
      , so I plan on studying and using Python much more once I've landed my
      first job. I am writing this project using Vite which I find to be much
      faster than CRA. Here is a link to my{" "}
      <a href="https://github.com/LutherA12" className="github-link">
        Github
      </a>{" "}
      account as well.
    </>

      If you've been through my code then you can already tell I'm a fan of
      lists! I do the same thing in Python as in React i.e. I hate when{" "}
      <span className="accents">my JSX and/or main coding base is</span> bogged
      down with text, constants, variables, functions, etc., obviously some of
      it is necessary and I'm not familiar with the state of production code,
      but I try to streamline things where ever possible to ensure the code I
      write is <span className="accents">scalable, reuseable and DRY.</span>{" "}
      However, and quite ironically, this intro alone has cost me three
      functions already. <span className="accents">Go figure.</span>
    </>
  ),
  body2: (
    <>
      Finally, I believe my strongest skills are my soft skills:{" "}
      <span className="accents">I'm a forever student</span> and always willing
      to learn what needs to be done in order to acheve success for any company
      I work with as well as myself.{" "}
      <span className="accents">
        I've worked with many different customers and technicians
      </span>{" "}
      over my previous jobs so I understand how to parse technical jorgon that I
      understand into everyday language without being condesending. I'm also
      primarily a kinesthetic learner, so I enjoy researching, "getting my hands
      dirty", and learning by doing. As a matter of fact, while writing this
      intro I had to research state to get this click effect running properly!
