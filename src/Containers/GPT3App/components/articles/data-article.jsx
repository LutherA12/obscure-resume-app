        Information! It's important in all aspects of life and AI is no

        Namely, we don't hold on to your personal search data unless you give us
        permission! It's all written down and available for you to read before
        you sign up, we are an open book so to speak and we strive to gain your
        trust directly, transparently, and honestly.
