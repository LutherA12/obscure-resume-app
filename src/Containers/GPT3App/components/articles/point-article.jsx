      <p>
        I'm glad you asked! The point is very simple, to help people. It may
        sound corny, contrived and cliche but it's true! Helping people is the
        main objective of this journey.
        <br />
        <br />
        If we dare to ask people to trust us, why would we not offer to help?
        How can we not serve people? It doesn't make any sense to us not to help
        people. Again, it may sound fake but that's how this started and how
        we've always been.
