      <h3>Open AI and GPT-3 a match made in Heaven!</h3>
      <p>
        As you may already know chat gpt is an AI system by which you can ask
        any question you want and the AI will filter your data using
        predetermined algorithms in order to get you the best results possible!{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        GPT-3 is that same process but on steroides! The filtering process is
        much more sophisticated and includes a wealth more information, not to
        mention we've tried hard to take all bias away so that the experience of
        asking a question is always a new one for you and the AI (even if it's
        the same question). There are of course special settings in place if you
        want to change this. How cool is that?!
