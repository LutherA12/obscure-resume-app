This will be my main web application resume; It will include various information about me, skills, things I would like to learn, some sample applications I've written and perhaps even some reading material; I will update this as much as possible while working my other projects while working toward my deadline;

Update 10/10/23: I've done quite a bit of work so far. I've used the map() for rendering so that my code remains as DRY as possible; I've also added a great deal of style and pulled some of my other apps into this one; I'm shooting for a total of 4 maybe 5 apps for this resume web page; I'm working another large application atm to add to this one, so expect to see another update coming soon;

Update 10/11/23: Just a small update, I've finished streamlining my resume onto my website portfolio which is about 50% done; I will now focus on my biggest project and finish that, then I will add a little something to one of my previous projects and start one more large scale project to round out my portfolio;

Update 10/18/23: Another smaller update, I've reworked and added some of the routes in my main application so that my GPT3 app has more functionallity now. In the coming weeks I will add Firebase to that app;

Update 06/28/2024 I've been working on this and other project so this update is a larger one; 
I've reworked this project so that it's more streamline, some of the SASS has been reworked and files/folders have been moved around for better understanding and accuracy; I've also moved most of the constants into their own files to create a better separation of concerns. I will be adding 2 new projects to my resume in the coming months;
