This will be my main web application resume; It will include various information about me, skills, things I would like to learn, some sample applications I've written and perhaps even some reading material; I will update this as much as possible while working my other projects while working toward my deadline;

Update 10/10/23: I've done quite a bit of work so far. I've used the map() for rendering so that my code remains as DRY as possible; I've also added a great deal of style and pulled some of my other apps into this one; I'm shooting for a total of 4 maybe 5 apps for this resume web page; I'm working another large application atm to add to this one, so expect to see another update coming soon;

Update 10/11/23: Just a small update, I've finished streamlining my resume onto my website portfolio which is about 50% done; I will now focus on my biggest project and finish that, then I will add a little something to one of my previous projects and start one more large scale project to round out my portfolio;
